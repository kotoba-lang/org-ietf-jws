;; `kotoba/jws/verify.kotoba` against `jws.core/verify`.
;;
;; The slice is the decision: may this token be verified at all, and over
;; what bytes. The guest is handed the three base64url parts and the decoded
;; header's fields; it never sees a key, a signature byte, or a decoded
;; payload. So the two are handed the SAME token and the same allow-list and
;; compared on the verdict and the reason for it.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; ## The host loop is the point
;;
;; `drive` is the deployment: base64url, JSON, and the signature check all
;; happen here, and each one is handed to the guest as the smallest thing
;; that answers a question -- the header as fields, the signature check as a
;; bool. If the guest refuses before `:want-signature`, the `:verify` fn is
;; never called at all, which is asserted rather than assumed
;; (`a-refusal-happens-before-the-key-is-touched`).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Each is a decision with a CVE-shaped history, and each is invisible to a
;; test that only ever verifies a good token:
;;
;;   * `unsecured-cannot-be-allowed-in` — `alg: none` is refused even when
;;     the caller names it in the allow-list. A reader that checks the
;;     allow-list first would let it through, and the allow-list is exactly
;;     where an operator would put it while debugging;
;;   * `the-header-does-not-choose-the-algorithm` — §10. A token signed with
;;     an algorithm the caller did not name is refused BY NAME, not reported
;;     as a bad signature: those are different facts;
;;   * `no-allowed-algorithms-is-refused-before-parsing` — a verifier with
;;     no names has not decided anything, and the only place left for the
;;     decision to come from is the token;
;;   * `crit-naming-an-unimplemented-header-invalidates` — §4.1.11. The
;;     producer used `crit` to say "reject this if you do not handle it", so
;;     ignoring it inverts the one thing it means;
;;   * `the-signing-input-is-built-from-the-encoded-parts` — §5.1. A
;;     verifier that re-encodes the decoded header signs a different string
;;     than the producer did, and the failure looks like a bad key.
