  "JSON Web Signature, Compact Serialization — [RFC 7515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.txt).

   The structure only. Signing and verifying are INJECTED, because a JWS library
   that also owns the cryptography ends up owning key custody too, and because the
   algorithms worth supporting here already exist next door:
   `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-ed25519` for `EdDSA` and the P-256 primitives in
   `kotoba-lang/org-w3-vc-data-integrity` for `ES256`.

   ## The verifier is TOLD the algorithm; it does not read it

   §4.1.1 requires `alg` to be present and understood, and §10 requires that it
   \"accurately represents the algorithm used to construct the JWS Signature\".
   Reading the algorithm out of the header and then using it to decide how to
   verify is the classic algorithm-substitution flaw: the header is supplied by
   whoever produced the token, so a verifier that trusts it lets the attacker
   choose the check.

   So `verify` REQUIRES `:expected-alg`, compares it to the header, and refuses a
   mismatch by name. Callers who genuinely accept several algorithms pass a set —
   which forces them to write down *which*, rather than accepting whatever arrives.

   `alg` `none` (§6, \"Unsecured JWS\") is refused unconditionally and cannot be
   enabled. RFC 7515 stops short of prohibiting it; every deployment that has
   accepted one has regretted it, and this library has no use case that needs a
   signature-shaped object with no signature.

   ## crit

   §4.1.11: if `crit` lists a header this implementation does not understand, the
   JWS is INVALID. Not ignored — the producer used `crit` precisely to say \"reject
   this if you don't handle it\", so ignoring it inverts the one thing it means.
